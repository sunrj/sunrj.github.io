Currently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Software Engineering Institute, East China Normal University, under the supervision of [Xuemin Lin](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lxue/) and [Xiaoyang Wang](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/xiaoyang-wang). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from Henan University in 2017, and Master’s degree in computer technology from Zhejiang Gongshang University in 2021.

My research interest lies in big data analytics, especially for the signed graph/network. Link to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7pePWUAAAAAJ&hl=en). Email address: renjie.sun@stu.ecnu.edu.cn
